# Complexity Class Oracle

## Purpose

Provides expert guidance on classifying problems into complexity classes and understanding their relationships.

## Capabilities

- Determine membership in P, NP, co-NP, PSPACE, EXPTIME
- Identify complete problems for each class
- Query known complexity results database
- Suggest proof strategies for classification
- Generate complexity landscape diagrams
- Track open problems and conjectures

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Problem Specification**: Define computational problem
2. **Class Analysis**: Identify candidate classes
3. **Evidence Gathering**: Find known results
4. **Classification**: Determine membership
5. **Documentation**: Generate classification proof

## Dependencies

- Complexity Zoo database
- Diagram generation tools

## Process Integration

- Computational Problem Classification
- NP-Completeness Proof workflows
