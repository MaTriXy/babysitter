Build a web based game that is a rogue-like astroids game.

with rich gameplay, levels, overworld, etc. RPG elements for character progression, items, skills, etc.

but the main feature is that there are 10+ different characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities, weapons, and abilities that effect the gameplay in a unique way.

a player can choose to play as a combination of 2 characters.

the game framework/sdk should be pluggable so that new characters can be added easily with all the various gameplay effects and dynamics that each characters combination may effect. it should also be possible to add new characters (and their combinations) to the game after the game is released.

we will code and generate assets for EACH combination of characters, so that we can have a rich and diverse game with a lot of replayability. each combination with each own story, level tweaks, etc. (build the process for this)

game look and feel should be retro NES style, pixel art, shaders for retro effects, etc.

game should have no server side components, all game logic should be client side run in the browser.

game should be playable in the browser, on desktop and mobile.

game should be fun and engaging, with a lot of replayability and a lot of content. it should not be too easy or too hard, it should be just right.

needs to be progressive and incremental development, iterative and quality gated.
