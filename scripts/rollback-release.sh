Usage: scripts/rollback-release.sh vX.Y.Z

Deletes the GitHub Release + tag for the provided version and removes the tag
from the remote. Run this from the repository root with a clone that has write
access to origin. The GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be authenticated (GH_TOKEN or
device login) before running the script.
USAGE

if git rev-parse "$TAG" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  git tag -d "$TAG"

git push origin ":refs/tags/$TAG"

cat <<'NEXT_STEPS'
Tag removed. If the release commit already merged to main, revert it (or cherry-pick
back the previous version) so CHANGELOG and package versions match the last good release.
Remember to re-open any reverted fixes in the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md.
